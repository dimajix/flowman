# Rebalance Mapping

Shuffles data to produce a specified amount of Spark partitions with an approximately equal number of records. This
is useful for balancing the processing load in clusters when the data is highly skewed.

## Example
```
mappings:
  balanced_dataset:
    kind: rebalance
    input: unbalanced_dataset
    partitions: 32
```

## Fields
* `kind` **(mandatory)** *(string)*: `rebalance`

* `broadcast` **(optional)** *(type: boolean)* *(default: false)*: 
Hint for broadcasting the result of this mapping for map-side joins.

* `cache` **(optional)** *(type: string)* *(default: NONE)*:
Cache mode for the results of this mapping. Supported values are
  * `NONE` - Disables caching of teh results of this mapping
  * `DISK_ONLY` - Caches the results on disk
  * `MEMORY_ONLY` - Caches the results in memory. If not enough memory is available, records will be uncached.
  * `MEMORY_ONLY_SER` - Caches the results in memory in a serialized format. If not enough memory is available, records will be uncached.
  * `MEMORY_AND_DISK` - Caches the results first in memory and then spills to disk.
  * `MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER` - Caches the results first in memory in a serialized format and then spills to disk.

* `input` **(mandatory)** *(string)*:
The name of the input mapping

* `partitions` **(mandatory)** *(integer)*:
The number of output partitions

* `filter` **(optional)** *(type: string)* *(default: empty)*:
  An optional SQL filter expression that is applied *before* the rebalance operation itself.


## Outputs
* `main` - the only output of the mapping
