# Flowman Schema Generator
The Flowman schema generator is a small utility application which generates a YAML schema file from the current
configuration including all plugins. This YAML schema file then can be used in appropriate code editors which
support schema validation of YAML files. This will support developers in creating Flowman projects.

```shell
flowman-schema -o my-schema-directory
```
