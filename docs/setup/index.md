# Setup & Configuration

Installing Flowman is relatively simple once you have a working Apache Spark environment. But even without a 
Hadoop/Spark environment you can resort to prebuilt Docker images for running Flowman in a non-distributed local mode
which is especially useful for development.

```eval_rst

   installation
