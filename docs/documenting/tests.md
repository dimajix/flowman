# Testing Model Properties

In addition to provide pure descriptions of model entities, the documentation framework in Flowman also provides
the ability to specify model properties (like unqiue values in a column, not null etc). These properties will not only
be part of the documentation, they will also be verified as part of generating the documentation.
