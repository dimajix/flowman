# Core Concepts

Flowman reduces the development efforts for creating robust and scalable data processing applications. At the heart
of Flowman are some basic concepts which provide the simple building blocks which can be used to build even complex
data transformations.

In order to appreciate the elegance and power of Flowman, it is important to understand the [core entities](entities.md),
which are used to model all the aspects of a data flow, like relations (which describe
data sources and sinks), mappings (which describe data transformations) and targets (which describe the actual work
to be performed).

In addition to understand the core entities, it is also important to understand Flowman's execution model which is
described in the [lifecycle documentation](lifecycle.md).
