## ü§î What is Flowman?

Flowman is a *data build tool* based on [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org) that simplifies the act of 
implementing data transformation logic as part of complex data pipelines. Flowman follows a strict "everything-as-code"
approach, where the whole transformation logic is specified in purely declarative YAML files.
These describe all details of the data sources, sinks and data transformations. This is much simpler and efficient
than writing Spark jobs in Scala or Python. Flowman will take care of all the technical details of a correct and robust 
implementation and the developers can concentrate on the data transformations themselves.

In addition to writing and executing data transformations, Flowman can also be used for managing physical data models, 
i.e. Hive or SQL tables. Flowman can create such tables from a specification with the correct schema and also 
automatically perform migrations. This helps to 
keep all aspects (like transformations and schema information) in a single place managed by a single tool.

## üí™ Noteable Features

* Semantics of a build tool like Maven ‚Äî just for data instead for applications
* Declarative syntax in YAML files
* Data model management (Create, Migrate and Destroy Hive tables, JDBC tables or file based storage)
* Generation of meaningful data model documentation 
* Flexible expression language for parametrizing a project for different environments (DEV, TEST, PROD)
* Jobs for managing build targets (like copying files or uploading data via sftp)
* Automatic data dependency management within the execution of individual jobs
* Meaningful logging output & rich set of execution metrics
* Powerful yet simple command line tools
* Extendable via Plugins


## üíæ Supported Data Sources and Sinks
Flowman supports a wide range of data sources, for example
* Various cloud blob storages (S3, ABS, ...)
* Relational databases (Postgres, Azure SQL, MS SQL Server, MariaDB, ...)
* Hadoop (HDFS & Hive)
* Streaming sources (Kafka)

For file-based sources and sinks, Flowman supports commonly used file formats like CSV, JSON, Parquet and much more. 
The official documentation provides an overview of
[supported connectors](https://docs.flowman.io/en/latest/connectors/index.html).
