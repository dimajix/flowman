# Tests

Flowman supports test cases as first order entities. These are used for creating self contained unittests to verify
the correctness of the specified data flow. Flowman provides mocking capabilities for mappings and relations such that
physical relations can be replaced by mocked virtual relations and mappings.

## Example
```yaml
tests:

## Fields
* `description` **(optional)** *(type: string)*:
  A textual description of the test


## Sub Pages
```eval_rst
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :glob:
