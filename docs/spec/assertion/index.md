# Assertions

Assertions are an important building block of test cases and validation/verification steps. Assertions are not a top
level entity like [targets](../target/index.md), [mappings](../mapping/index.md), [job](../job/index.md), etc... Instead,
assertions are used as part of [tests](../test/index.md) and [validation](../target/validate.md) and 
[verification](../target/verify.md) targets.

## Assertion Types
```eval_rst
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :glob:

   *
```
